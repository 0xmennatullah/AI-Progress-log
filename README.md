## Deep Learning  

1. [Intro to DL (Kaggle Cert)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/menatullahkhaled/intro-to-deep-learning)
   - better model head function declarations  
   - ensemble methods explained nicely   

2. [Nvidia's Getting Started with Deep Learning](https://learn.nvidia.com/certificates?id=P55htmDaTb6a9p5p4cXo3w) 
   - nice attention and transformers explaination -embedding wise-.
   - implements some NLP l6.
   - very good explained labs.

3. [DL Implementations]()![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue) 
   
4. [Dive in Deeplearning Book](https://d2l.ai/)![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue)

5. [Andrew NG | MIT 2026 DL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ZsU44qY66KgbeP3o&v=_NLHFoVNlbg&feature=youtu.be) ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Ongoing-blue)

## Computer Vision  

1. [Intro to CV (Kaggle Cert)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/menatullahkhaled/computer-vision)  
   - good feature extraction breakdown  

2. [UMICH - DL for CV (2019)](https://github.com/0xmennatullah/Deep-learning-for-Computer-vision.git)
   - daydream explanation  
   - gradient ascent reviewed well
